Here we list the experimental configurations that we used to generate
results in our NDSS 2012 paper (Making argument systems for outsourced
computation practical (sometimes)).

1. For Figure 5, we run pepper with the following parameters for each
model computation:
  (a) #instances = 1 that can be passed using -b=1
  (b) input size = 100 by using -i=100
  (c) #repetitions by using -r=[1|70]
  (d) varying key sizes: 512, 704, and 1024 (that can be set in crypto/crypto.h)

2. For Figure 6, we pre-installed the commitment query on the prover and
run Habanero with the following parameters and model computations.
  (a) Matrix multiplication with -i=200, -b=100
  (b) Poly d2 with -i=500, -b=200
  (c) Poly d3 with -i=200, -b=350
