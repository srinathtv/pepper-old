Pepper's source code is released under a BSD-style license. See LICENSE
for more details.

PREREQUISITES:
Pepper's code requires the following packages to be installed. 

  - GMP
  - FCGI
  - Apache2 with PHP module and FastCGI module
  - PAPI
  - libcurl
  - Chacha pseudorandom number generator
  - sfslite
  - libconfig

CONFIGURATION and SETUP:
  
  - Build pepper's code by running make

  Here we describe setup instructions to run pepper using two machines:
  one for the verifier and another one for the prover.
  
  On the prover machine do the following:
  
  - After installing apache2 from source or a package, run apache2 with
    the config file present in www/apache.conf. 

  - Update PHP's ini file to allow file uploads and increase the default
    POST limit.

  - Copy the prover's executables and the php files under "www" folder
    to the apache's root directory.

  - Create a folder /mnt/computation_state and change the folder
    permissions so that the PHP scripts and the executables can read and
    write data to that folder

  On the verifier machine, do the following:
  
  - Create a folder /mnt/computation_state


To outsource and verify a computation (e.g. matrix multiplication), run 
./bin/matrix_cubicp_v -b [# instances] -r [#repetitions] -i [input size]
-v [0 for pepper and 1 for Habanero] -o 0 -s [prover's name e.g.
http://server/]
